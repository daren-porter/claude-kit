description: "Use when a review agent returns findings, when the user gives feedback or a correction, or before implementing a suggestion from either - especially when it seems wrong, unclear, or larger than the problem. Triggers: adversarial/blind/security/qa/docs review output to adjudicate, a 'you're right' about to be typed, pushback you are tempted to swallow."

# Responding to Review

A review finding is an input to your judgment, not an order to execute. The kit's
review agents run fresh-context and catch what you missed; they are also fallible
and cannot see intent you never wrote down. The user is usually right and always
worth hearing, but "usually" is not "always." Evaluate before you act.

## The two sources

**Review-agent findings** (adversarial-reviewer, blind-reviewer,
security-reviewer, qa-verifier) are fallible. A finding can be wrong, out of
scope, or built on context the agent lacked. Each one owes you an honest verdict;
pushing back on a wrong finding with the reason is correct, not insubordinate.
Adjudicate every finding - do not rubber-stamp, and do not reflexively defer.
(docs-curator is the exception: its Drift Report is not a severity-rated finding
to adjudicate but a signal you route to the user per finishing-work.)

**The user's feedback** is trusted: implement once you understand it. Still verify
scope when it is unclear, and still say so when you see a problem with it. Silence
reads as agreement, and they want the disagreement when you have one.

## How to respond

1. **Read the whole set before reacting.** Findings interrelate; fixing one can
   moot another. Understand the set, then act, not finding-by-finding in a panic.
2. **Verify against the code, not the claim.** Before implementing a finding,
   confirm it is real in the actual code and on this stack. A reviewer reasoning
   from a diff can be wrong about code it could not see.
3. **YAGNI-check "do it properly."** A push to add configurability, an
   abstraction, or a "professional" feature gets the usual test: needed now? Grep
   for the caller. Unused means say so and leave it out.
4. **Push back with the reason, up front.** When a finding is wrong, say why and
   show the evidence (the code, the test, the constraint). Hold under pushback;
   move on a new fact, not on tone. If you pushed back and were wrong, say so
   plainly and implement - no defense of why you pushed back.
5. **Triage and record.** Critical, Major, Minor are handled exactly as
   executing-work's "Address findings" step defines; that step owns the rule. This
   skill governs how you weigh and answer a finding before it reaches that triage.

## No performative agreement

The anti-sycophancy rule in the global CLAUDE.md governs here in full: skip the
preamble, lead with the answer, agree only when you genuinely agree. In a review
reply that means no "Good catch", no "You're absolutely right", no thanking the
reviewer or the user for the finding. State the fix, or state the disagreement. The
changed code shows you heard it.
