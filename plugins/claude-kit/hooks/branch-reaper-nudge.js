// SessionStart hook: branch-hygiene trigger (reapable AND stranded branches).
//
// At session start, refresh the merge state and surface two conditions that
// both call for the branch-hygiene skill:
//   - Reapable: local branches merged into the integration ref (the first of
//     origin/develop, origin/main, origin/master that exists). Safe to sweep.
//   - Stranded: local branches whose remote is GONE (the PR merged or the branch
//     was deleted) yet whose tip is NOT on the integration ref, so they carry
//     commit(s) that never reached the trunk and will be lost if pruned. This is
//     the post-merge doc-strand failure the push guard prevents going forward and
//     this net catches after the fact. The current branch is reapable-protected
//     but still surfaced when stranded: being parked on one is the worst case.
//
// The hook NEVER deletes anything: it detects with pure git (no host CLI) and
// hands off to the branch-hygiene skill, which classifies and recovers.
//
// Fail-open and non-blocking: a bounded fetch with auth prompts disabled and a
// short timeout, skipped when the repo was fetched recently; any error exits 0
// with no output. Kept separate from session-start.js so the resume hook is
// untouched.
