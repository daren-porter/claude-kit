// Stop hook: kit-native goal leash, run at turn end.
//
// A strict no-op unless a goal is armed for this project (.kit/goal-state.json).
// When one is armed and this session is the one holding it, the hook holds the
// session to completion by blocking the stop, allowing it only when the run is
// genuinely done or a true blocker has been surfaced.
//
// The blast is project-wide (every Stop in every kit repo runs this), so the
// design fails safe on every axis:
//   - The no-goal path is a single cheap read.
//   - A stop is BLOCKED only when the leash is affirmatively holding: the goal
//     is armed, this session holds it, the plan is not done, and the last
//     message did not lead with 'BLOCKED:'.
//   - Whenever an allow condition cannot be determined (a transcript that cannot
//     be read, a tail caught mid-write), the stop is ALLOWED, not blocked: a
//     released leash is a recoverable stop, while a spurious block traps the
//     session. A bug anywhere exits 0 with no output, so the hook never
//     crash-traps a session.
//
// Allow order:
//   0.  no goal armed: allow (the hot path for every session everywhere).
//   0b. scoping by session identity. The goal binds to exactly one session:
//         - Bound to THIS session: leashed, proceed to enforcement.
//         - Bound to another session: allow. A session that merely mentions the
//           plan is never leashed, and re-arming is the documented recovery when
//           the bound session dies (see the kit-goal skill).
//         - Unbound: the first session whose genuine user-typed text carries the
//           plan path inside a <command-args> span (the /kit-goal arming
//           invocation, including a re-arm after a crash) claims the binding and
//           is enforced; every other session is allowed. Plain prose merely
//           mentioning the path never claims, nor does harness-injected feedback
//           (isMeta) or an assistant echo.
//       Binding is best-effort: a failed bind write still enforces this stop and
//       is retried at the next stop, so a persistence hiccup never releases a
//       genuinely leashed session.
//   a.  plan Status is Complete, or the plan file is gone (archived): auto-clear
//       the goal and allow.
//   b.  the last assistant message leads with 'BLOCKED:': allow. The harness can
//       still be appending the turn's final entries when the hook runs, so a
//       read that does not resolve the last turn (no lead found, or a partial
//       mid-append final line) is retried briefly; only a persistent no blocks,
//       and a persistent partial tail stays indeterminate: allow.
//   else: block with a reason naming the plan and the ways out.
//
// The hook re-evaluates these conditions on EVERY stop attempt, including inside
// a stop-hook continuation (stop_hook_active), so the leash holds until an allow
// condition is genuinely met rather than releasing after a single block. Loop
// safety is the harness's, not ours: Claude Code overrides a Stop hook after it
// blocks eight consecutive times without progress (CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP),
// so a genuinely stuck session is released by the harness with a visible warning.

//   - Assistant entries are skipped entirely: an assistant echo of the plan path

//     working the plan.
