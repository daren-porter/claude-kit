# Writing Skills

A skill is behavior-shaping prose, not documentation. One that reads well but does
not change what an agent does under pressure is decoration. Treat a skill change
like a code change: name the failure it fixes, pick the form that fixes that
failure, and confirm it works before trusting it.

## When a skill earns its place

- **Create when:** the technique is non-obvious, recurs across efforts, and is
  general. A single project's convention is not a skill; it goes in that project's
  CLAUDE.md.
- **Do not create when:** it is a one-off, a restatement of standard practice, or
  something a hook or regex can enforce mechanically. Automate the mechanical
  ones; reserve skills for judgment.
- **The kit stays lean.** Every skill is paid for in every session's skill list. A
  new skill must beat the alternative of one more paragraph in an existing skill.
  When in doubt, fold it in rather than add a file.

## Anatomy

- One SKILL.md, in the kit's voice: direct, opinionated, anti-dogma, no em dashes.
  Add a reference file only when the body genuinely outgrows the size of the kit's
  other skills, and then gate it the way csharp-style and sql-style do: the
  SKILL.md covers routine work, and it names the territories that need the
  reference.
- **Frontmatter: always quote the description.** An unquoted `": "` silently
  breaks the YAML and drops all skill metadata (learned the hard way on
  csharp-style). `name` and `description` are the two that matter.
- Body: the principle, the rules that carry judgment, the antipatterns. Tables and
  lists for what gets scanned; prose for the why. A flowchart only for a decision
  where the agent might genuinely go wrong, never for linear steps.

## The description states the trigger, not the workflow

The description is how a future session decides whether to load the skill. Write
it as "Use when..." plus the symptoms that pull it in, and stop. Do not summarize
the skill's process there: an agent that reads a process summary acts on the
summary and skips the body, so a step the body insists on gets dropped.

The kit has a live specimen. executing-work's description ends with "Works section
by section with adversarial subagent review and Chapter checkpoints" - a process
recap a loading agent can act on in place of the seven-step section loop the body
actually defines. (Superpowers reports measuring this kind of drift: a description
that summarized "code review between tasks" yielded one review where the body
specified two. Treat that as a caution, not a citation.) Name when the skill
applies; let the body say what to do.

## Match the form to the failure

Name the failure first, then pick the form that fixes it. The form that
bulletproofs one failure backfires on another:

| The failure | The form that fixes it | The form that backfires |
|---|---|---|
| Knows the rule, skips it under pressure | Prohibition + rationalization table + red-flags list | Soft "prefer..." guidance |
| Complies, but the output is wrong-shaped (bloated, buried, restated) | A positive recipe: state what the output IS, its parts in order | A prohibition list ("don't restate", "never narrate") |
| Omits a required element from something it already produces | A structural slot: a REQUIRED field in the template it fills | Prose reminders near the template |
| Behavior should depend on a condition | A conditional on an observable predicate ("if the brief exists, reference it") | An unconditional rule plus exemption clauses |

Two rules govern any rule you write, not just the four forms above:
- **No nuance clauses.** "Don't X unless it matters" reopens the negotiation.
  Express a real exception as its own conditional on something observable.
- **Exemption clauses do not scope.** "This limit excludes code blocks" still
  suppresses code blocks. If part of the output must be exempt, restructure so the
  rule cannot reach it.

## Know it works before you trust it

A skill you wrote and never tested is a guess. The honest test is to watch an
agent's behavior with and without the wording:

1. **RED:** give a fresh subagent a realistic task that tempts the failure,
   without the new guidance. Watch it fail; record the rationalization verbatim.
   If it does not fail, there is nothing to fix - stop.
2. **GREEN:** add the minimal guidance addressing that specific failure. Re-run.
   The agent should now comply.
3. **REFACTOR:** if it finds a new loophole, add the counter and re-run until it
   holds. For discipline rules, combine pressures (time + sunk cost + authority);
   single pressures are weak tests.

Run several reps - one sample lies - and read every flagged result yourself, since
template echoes masquerade as both failures and successes. This is the standard
for any change to behavior-shaping content, the kit's own skills included.

## Antipatterns

- A narrative ("the time we fixed X") instead of a reusable technique.
- A description that summarizes the workflow.
- A prohibition aimed at a wrong-shaped-output problem (use a recipe).
- Guidance written from imagination instead of an observed failure.
- A new skill where one paragraph in an existing skill would have done.
